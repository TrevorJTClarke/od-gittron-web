## Development

1. Install dependencies

```bash
yarn install
```

2. Copy sample .env.sample to .env.|ENVIRONMENT_NAME|

   **Note**: Ensure your `.env` file is up to date with the latest `.env.sample` file. New environment variables may
   have been changed or added, which could result in a bad build.

   ```
   $ cp .env.sample .env
   ```

3. Make any necessary environment variable changes

4. Run a dev server

```bash
yarn start
```

### Linting
